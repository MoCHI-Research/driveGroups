# DriveGroups Backend Installation Guide
Welcome to the DriveGroups project! This guide will help you run the DriveGroups backend on your machine. The backend consists of a Spring Boot API and a PostgreSQL database.

## Recommended Software
 - Homebrew for Macs - useful for installing other software. [Install Here](https://brew.sh/).
 - PostgreSQL - the databse used in this project. Install using Homebrew: `brew install postgresql@14`
     - When Homebrew asks if you want to make this a service, make sure to say yes. This will make sure you don't have to start it every time you use your computer. The battery life impact is negligible.
 - PgAdmin 4 - useful for creating and managing databases. Install using Homebrew: `brew install --cask pgadmin4`
 - Dbeaver - better for inspecting the contents of databases. Install using Homebrew: `brew install --cask dbeaver-community`
 - IntelliJ Idea - the best IDE for Spring Boot. Install the JetBrains Toolbox, Install IntelliJ: `brew install --cask jetbrains-toolbox`

## Optional Software
 - Postman - helpful for debugging APIs. Very friendly user interface. Install using Homebrew: `brew install --cask postman`
